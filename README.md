This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

# Optimization Plan

## Current Implementation

The app currently handles a moderate number of superheroes with basic performance optimizations:
- Local caching of superhero data
- Virtualized lists for rendering large collections
- Basic image optimization

## Future Optimization Strategies

### 1. Data Handling for Large Datasets
**Problem**: As the number of superheroes grows, memory usage and loading times may increase.

**Solutions**:
- Implement pagination or infinite scrolling
- Add data partitioning (load only visible items + buffer)
- Use SQLite for local storage instead of AsyncStorage for better query performance
- Implement data compression for stored superhero information

### 2. Performance Improvements
**Problem**: Users report slow performance, especially on lower-end devices.

**Solutions**:
- **Code Splitting**: Split the bundle into smaller chunks
- **Image Optimization**:
  - Implement progressive image loading
  - Use WebP format with fallbacks
  - Add proper image caching with size limits
- **Memoization**:
  - Use `React.memo` for pure components
  - Implement `useMemo` and `useCallback` for expensive calculations
- **Reduce Re-renders**:
  - Implement proper state management
  - Use React's `memo` for list items

### 3. Network Optimization
- Implement request debouncing for search
- Add request cancellation for abandoned API calls
- Use GraphQL to fetch only required fields
- Implement proper error boundaries and retry mechanisms

### 4. User Experience
- Add skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
- Implement optimistic UI updates
- Add pull-to-refresh with visual feedback
- Implement proper error states and retry mechanisms

### 5. Monitoring and Analytics
- Add performance monitoring (e.g., React Native Performance)
- Track slow renders and interactions
- Monitor memory usage and crashes
- Collect user interaction metrics to identify bottlenecks

## Pending Improvements
1. **Testing**: Add performance testing for large datasets
2. **Accessibility**: Improve screen reader support
3. **Offline Support**: Enhance offline capabilities with background sync
4. **Asset Optimization**: Further optimize assets and bundle size

## Why These Improvements?
The current implementation focuses on core functionality first. The proposed optimizations address potential scaling issues while maintaining a balance between performance and development complexity. Each optimization can be implemented incrementally based on actual performance metrics and user feedback.
